# 📡 Real-Time Network Traffic Monitoring with Wireshark & SigNoz

This individual research lab focuses on capturing and analyzing real-time network traffic using **Wireshark** and **SigNoz**, with telemetry collected via **OpenTelemetry**. The goal is to detect anomalies, visualize system behavior, and support early-stage threat identification.

## 📌 Project Overview

Network visibility is a crucial component of modern cybersecurity. This project integrates packet-level inspection using Wireshark and end-to-end observability using SigNoz to monitor and analyze:

- Suspicious communication patterns
- Latency and packet drop spikes
- Protocol misuse
- Live telemetry for microservices and endpoints

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Wireshark** – GUI tool for deep packet inspection  
- **tcpdump** – CLI-based packet capturing  
- **SigNoz** – Telemetry monitoring and visualization  
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** – Unified telemetry pipeline  
- **Docker Compose** – SigNoz deployment  
- **Ubuntu Server 20.04** – Test environment

## 🧩 Key Activities

- ✅ Captured and dissected network traffic with Wireshark and tcpdump  
- ✅ Integrated SigNoz with OpenTelemetry to stream trace and metrics data  
- ✅ Developed dashboards to monitor:
  - Network latency and throughput
  - Request rate anomalies
  - Protocol usage distribution
- ✅ Identified potential malicious behaviors such as:
  - Port scanning
  - Brute-force login attempts
  - Unusual destination IPs
